    "text": "The dataset established by Tran, Nguyen, and Le (2025) collects comprehensive data on students and alumni from the VNU University of Education to identify the internal and external factors that drive academic success. Similar to international assessments, it captures contextual information on student demographics, family socioeconomic status, and institutional factors such as lecturer quality and university facilities. This study provides a rigorous framework for understanding how student learning outcomes, measured by Grade Point Average (GPA), are influenced by the evolving demands of the digital age.\nThe results from this dataset offer significant insights into the equity and quality of education within the Vietnamese context, allowing educational administrators and policy makers to benchmark performance against global standards. The goal of this research is to shift the focus toward proactive intervention, enabling lecturers and academic advisors to use data-driven insights to improve student motivation and performance. By establishing shared points of reference regarding peer influence, teaching methods, and school support, the dataset encourages a shift from traditional internal reviews to an outward-looking, evidence-based approach to educational management.\nThe survey was conducted in 2023 and involved a robust sample of 2,170 validated responses from both current students and graduated alumni, providing a longitudinal perspective on the factors affecting learning outcomes."

    "text": "5 Summary\nThis analysis is based on a selected survey sample and may not fully represent the broader student population. As such, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to potential sampling bias. In addition, the reliance on Likert-scale measures introduces subjectivity, as responses may reflect individual biasness. Variables such as adaptation to university learning, study methods, and perceived lecturer quality may therefore be influenced by personal interpretation.\nAmong the factors examined, parental education and time spent studying demonstrate the most consistent positive associations with higher GPA. Institutional factors, including university support and training curriculum, show comparatively weaker and less consistent relationships. Interestingly, some high-performing students report minimal lecturer support, which may indicate stronger intrinsic motivation or greater independent learning capability rather than an absence of institutional influence.\nOverall, the observed association between parental education and academic performance highlights the potential influence of family socioeconomic background on student outcomes.\n\n5.1 Key Findings\n\nMost respondents achieved a GPA of 2.5 (Fair) or higher.\nFemale students were observed to have a higher proportion of GPAs at 3.2 (Good) or above. However, this difference should be interpreted cautiously, as the survey sample consisted predominantly of female respondents.\nParental education appears to be associated with students’ academic performance. Higher parental educational attainment is linked to a greater likelihood of achieving higher GPAs, with the association appearing stronger for mothers, particularly at the graduate level.\nA positive relationship is observed between time spent studying and GPA, suggesting that greater study time is associated with improved academic outcomes.\nThe relationship between time spent on social media and GPA is mixed. This may indicate that moderate social media use does not necessarily hinder performance and could potentially serve as a supplementary learning resource.\nIn cases where lecturer support was absent, the results are less consistent.\n\nStudents reporting minimal support tended to show stronger GPA outcomes.\nInterestingly, students reporting no lecturer support exhibited the highest proportion of GPAs at 3.2 or above across support levels.\nFurther examination suggests that longer study time, more effective study methods, and patterns of social media use may compensate for limited lecturer support in achieving higher academic performance.\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Recommendation for Future Work\n\nFurther investigation is needed to better understand the extent of parental engagement in students’ education, as educational attainment alone may not fully reflect the level of involvement or support provided at home.\nIn addition, examining the specific purposes of social media use (i.e for entertainment, communication, or academic learning) would allow for a more accurate interpretation of its relationship with academic performance.\nAs the current analysis is largely descriptive, additional statistical tests could be conducted to formally statitically support the observed relationships.\nThe observation that students reporting no lecturer support nonetheless perform well warrants further examination. This may help clarify whether individual independence or self-directed learning plays a significant role in academic achievement."

The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2.
