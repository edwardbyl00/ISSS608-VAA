# Getting Started

## Install and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages have been installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE,fill=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = scales::percent(after_stat(count / sum(count)),accuracy = 0.1)),
    stat = "count",
    vjust = -0.3) +
  labs(y = "Number of Students")
```
